# Project Todos

The assignment was:

- Your app should list all todo tasks - completed or uncompleted
- You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncomplete)
- You should be able to add and remove tasks
- Your app should show a count of either all todos or all uncomplete todos (or both)

## The problem

At first I had a challenge getting the counter to work.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
