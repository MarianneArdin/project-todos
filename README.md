# Project Todos

The assignment was:

- Your app should list all todo tasks - completed or uncompleted
- You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncomplete)
- You should be able to add and remove tasks
- Your app should show a count of either all todos or all uncomplete todos (or both)

## The problem

At first I had a challenge getting the counter to work.
